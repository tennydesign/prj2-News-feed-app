# News Feed App - iOSi SF Project #2 
My second project: A News Feed App. This was maybe the most significant technical leap in the immersive. Night and day from the Todo List App. This project features: 
- GCD async queues.
- Core Data. 
- CoreLocation (feeding weather forecast API).
- JSON serialization using Decodable objects.
- JSON parsing. 
- URL sessions. 
- Access to two different APIs (three with https://api.datamuse.com, but ended up not using it, code is there). Each with many end-points. 
- My very own Protocols, Singletons and Delegates. 
- Very intricate Date formatting. 
- Network reachability test. 
- Cocoa Pods
- MVC based architecture.
- OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- Non-standard animation features.
- XIB files for more design flexibility on cells. 
- Ability to share news via social media or messaging outlets. 
- Auto-layout for portrait and landscape, any device. 
- Some fair use of programatic layouting 
- Apple's Material Design and Human Interface Guidelines. 
- Balsamiq prototype.
- POP (Marvel) prototype.
